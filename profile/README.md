# Welcome to StealthCRX 🏗️

### Automating outdated industries with Embodied AI

We are an applied robotics company building the autonomous workforce for field industrial appliactions. Our mission is to bridge the gap between skilled labor demands and workforce availability using next-generation **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models.

## Current Focus: VLA for Unstructured Environments
We are currently developing **JS-VLA**, a foundation model capable of understanding complex site instructions and translating them into robotic actions.

### Key Challenges We Solve:
* **Occlusion:** Handling "blind spots" when tools or obstacles block the view.
* **Dynamic Safety:** Navigating sites with moving workers and changing layouts.
* **Sim-to-Real:** Bridging the gap between simulation and the dusty, messy reality of real world environments.
